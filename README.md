# Lending Club Loan Data Analysis

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and financial insights** using **Lending Club loan data** from Kaggle. I performed **data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis** to uncover key financial patterns, loan defaults, and risk factors.

## **Project Highlights**
âœ… **Data Source:** Kaggle (Lending Club Loan Data)  
âœ… **Visualization Tool:** Tableau  
âœ… **Key Analysis Areas:** Loan status, interest rates, borrower risk profiling, and lending trends  
âœ… **Interactive Dashboard:** Published on Tableau Public  

## **Published Visualization**
ðŸŽ¯ **View my Tableau Dashboard:** [Northeastern RAF Lender Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ramish.fatima/viz/Northeastern_RAF_LenderData/Dashboard1#2Links)

## **Data Source**
ðŸ“‚ **Kaggle Dataset:** [Lending Club Insightful Financial EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kabure/lending-club-insightful-financial-eda/input)

## **Steps Followed**
### **1. Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Extracted Lending Club loan dataset from Kaggle.
- Removed **missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns**.
- Standardized data formats (e.g., `loan_status`, `interest_rate`).

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Loan Default Analysis:** Identified patterns in loan defaults based on credit grades.
- **Interest Rate Distribution:** Analyzed interest rate variations by loan amount and term.
- **Borrower Segmentation:** Grouped borrowers based on income, loan purpose, and credit history.
- **Risk Profiling:** Assessed risk factors affecting loan approval and repayment success.

### **3. Data Visualization & Insights**
âœ… **Loan Status Distribution** (Charged Off, Fully Paid, Current)  
âœ… **Interest Rate Trends** by loan amount and term  
âœ… **Top Reasons for Loan Defaults**  
âœ… **Credit Score Impact on Loan Approval**  
âœ… **Debt-to-Income Ratio Analysis**  

## **Findings & Insights**
ðŸ“Œ **Higher credit scores correlated with lower interest rates and higher approval rates.**  
ðŸ“Œ **Short-term loans had significantly higher interest rates compared to long-term loans.**  
ðŸ“Œ **Debt-to-income ratio was a critical factor in determining borrower risk.**  
ðŸ“Œ **Top reasons for loan defaults included debt consolidation and small business loans.**  

## **Future Enhancements**
ðŸ”¹ **Feature Engineering:** Add more derived features for better insights.  
ðŸ”¹ **Predictive Modeling:** Implement ML models to forecast loan defaults.  
ðŸ”¹ **More Interactive Visuals:** Enhance Tableau dashboards with drill-down analytics.  
ðŸ”¹ **Real-time Data Updates:** Automate dataset updates for ongoing analysis.
